# Automated Market Maker (AMM)

## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of an automated market maker (AMM) for a single token pair. The AMM is implemented as a smart contract that can be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The AMM contract can be used to swap tokens between the two token types. The AMM contract is also used to provide liquidity to the AMM. The AMM contract is implemented in Solidity and tested using the Hardhat framework.

## Usage

```npm install```

```npx hardhat node```

```npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost```

```npx hardhat run scripts/seed.js --network localhost```

```npm run start```

## Testing

```npx hardhat test```
